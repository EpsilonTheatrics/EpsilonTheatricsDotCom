    <h4 class="content-text">EpsilonTheatrics is small theater tech startup created by Finlay Christ. We are in the
      process of developing two main peices of software. PowerCues which is a theater control program capable of
      controlling lights over DMX using various usb to DMX controllers including the ETC Gadget II and any open DMX
      enabled controller. And EZPatch an IOS/Android app for easily inputting patching information on your phone and
      then sending it to PowerCues.</h4>
    <br />
    <h4 class="content-text">Development Update 2/4/2024: Project is still in active development but funding is tight
      and DMX hardware is expensive. Development will continue more officially when I can afford an ETC Nomad.</h4>
